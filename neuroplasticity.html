      <h1>NEUROPLASTICITY</h1> 
      <br><br>
      <h3>NEUROPLASTICITY BENEFITS</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity can help us learn how to learn better. When we are learning new things, our neurons are growing new pathways, and as we continue to practice (repetition matters!) and learn at high intensity, this neuron pathway in our brains is growing stronger and wider as we practice. Just like weight training will help grow muscles, we can exercise our brains and thus make them grow.
        </p>
        <P>
          Learning and growth here is not limited to learning a new skill, but also includes the way we think, our mindset, whether we have the confidence and resilience to face new challenges.
        </P>
      <br>
      <h3>ENGAGING NEUROPLASTICITY</h3>
        <p>
          Knowing this, the impact on me is that I can face challenges more positively and know that with constant practice and challenging myself I will get results and can change my brain and mind-set.
        </p>
        <P>
          I am going to try to practice more when I learn new skills, consolidate my learning, and use this as an opportunity to create new neuronal pathways when faced with challenges. When a critical voice comes up in my brain, I can change my thinking patterns by taking deep breaths and practicing mindfulness to stop the critical voice.
        </P>

      <br>
      <h3>GROWTH MINDSET</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is seeing challenges as opportunities for self-growth, and see failure as ‘not yet’, see it as an effort we put in. And we won’t be defined by failure.
        </p>
        <P>
          Most of the students who join Dev are first-time programmers, and we will inevitably face many challenges in such a high-intensity learning environment, not only on skills but also on mindset and attitude. To become a good programmer, Dev is just the first step in the journey, and we will encounter more challenges in the work afterwards, and having a growth mindset will, in short, allow us to grow happier and more smoothly.
        </P><br>
      <h3>SHAPE MY LEARNING STRATEGY</h3>
      <P>
        I had previously focused more on how to learn specific skills rather than mindset. I was surprised to learn through my research that the difference in mindset has a very large impact on learning outcomes.
      </P>
      <P>
        I will stick to a positive meditation twice a day to help me develop a good mindset for learning.
