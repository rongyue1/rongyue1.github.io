      <h1>IDENTITY & VALUES</h1> 
      <br><br>
      <h4>CORE VALUES</h4>
      <p>Curiosity: I believe it is the best motivation to learn, it follows one's interest and naturally lead the following exploration. </p>
      <p>The ability to reflect on ourselves: I reflect on myself a lot, about just almost everything. Reflecting helps me to increase self-awareness, so I can become a better version of me and bring positive influence to people around me.</p>
      <p>Authenticity: Always be true to myself and people around me.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>ETHICAL DECISION</h4>
      <p>Before I joined Dev, I worked in a centre as an early childhood teacher. In mentoring program for teacher registration, my mentor comes to the centre and assess my practice once a year. During one of the evaluations, she praised my project and was amazed by the theoretical study I had put behind it. But the truth is I was given a lot of help by another teacher in our centre who was under the same mentor as me. I had a choice to make whether to tell my mentor about my colleague's contribution. I know I would feel terrible if I take all the credit, even though I might get a great result on the teacher registration review. So, I told my mentor which parts of the project she had contributed and the articles she recommended to me really enhanced my understanding on the topic. </p>
      <p>The consequences of being authentic and honest were that later in her evaluation my mentor brought this up with my colleague who was, at that time, a new teacher in our centre, and my colleague appreciated what I did and told me that she felt included and valued in this new environment, and that was the start of our friendship.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>CULTURAL INFLUENCE</h4>
      <p>I was born and raised in China, what my Chinese cultural background and upbringing has influence on my identity in the way I treat people around me. I try to be supportive and authentic, and when I ask my friend about their impression of me, that’s normally what they would say.</p>
      <p>Being a queer in China is not easy, the process of finding who I am and accepting that has been a big growth for me. This experience has taught me to be a reflective person with the ability to question authority.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>STRENGTHS</h4>
      <p>I work well with people once we get to know each other more. I am a reflective person and willing to take advice. I enjoy learning new things and technology, my curiosity has been a good driver on my learning journey.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
      <p>I am not always a confident person. With the cultural and language barrier, when I join a new environment, I can be a bit timid and reserved. So, it sometimes can be hard for me to ask people for help.</p>
      <p>I think my personality and the way I work with people can help me fitting in a new environment, and by helping each other at work can really bring people together as a team.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>WORKING STRATEGY</h4>
      <p>When I was working as part of the teaching team, we had a student teacher coming for their practicum. They spent most of the time observing children’s learning, however we expect the student teacher to take on more responsibility in daily routine, really get engaged as an early childhood teacher and have more interactions with te tamariki. As I was the teacher responsible for the outside area and she stayed mainly outside, I wasn’t happy with their performance. So, I raised the issue to our team leader, who was also their mentor. They talked later, the student teacher started to get more involved in children’s play and contributed more ideas in environment setting. </p>
      <p>What I would do differently is to have a korero directly with the student teacher before go to the head teacher, just to figure out why they chose the way to do the practicum, maybe they were a bit shy in a new centre, and is there anything I can do to help them settle in. I could take more initiative in this matter.</p>
