      <h1>FOUNDATIONS REFLECTION</h1>
      <br /><br />
      <h3>NEW THINGS I HAVE LEARNT</h3>
      <p>I learnt that it is hard for me to open up and reach for help.</p>
      <p>
        I found that it is hard to focus on learning when I’m down, but I learnt
        mindfulness skills to help me focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need to remember we all learn differently and have different strength
        and limitations, compete only with myself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY AND SELF-AWARENESS</h3>
      <p>
        Those are significant things in learning and programing. It’s important
        to have empathy to other people and also to ourselves, take ‘mistakes’
        as opportunities for growth, and don’t let our ego getting in the way
        for us to become better programmers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>WHAT HAS SURPRISED ME THE MOST</h3>
      <p>
        Definitely the sprint four, neuroplasticity and growth mindset. I was
        surprised to find out that our mindset can have such a big impact on
        learning outcomes, while changing my mindset can make the whole learning
        process more enjoyable and make the critical voices in my head less
        critical so that I can focus more on learning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>CHALLENGING ASPECT</h3>
      <p>
        That would be the first part, introduce myself to the group and share my
        values and identities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>WHY DO WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON CORE LEARNING</h3>
      <p>
        Because it’s important! Programmers are problem solvers which means we
        are spending long hours in solving puzzles and it can be frustrating
        sometimes, so it is important to have a growth mindset and be kind to
        ourselves when we face challenge. Another reason is that we work as a
        team, have empathy and respect for each other is crucial.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>CORE LEARNING, A WASTE OF TIME?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Through the core learning, I have become more aware of my strengths
        and limitations. On the other hand, I think not only the study itself is
        important, but also the ‘not yet’ attitude when I face challenges.
