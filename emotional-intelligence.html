      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is
        the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive
        ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others,
        overcome challenges and defuse conflict.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
      <p>
        IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or
        communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize
        emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your
        decisions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
      <p>
        Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows us to empathize
        with others, communicate effectively and be both self and socially
        aware. How we respond to ourselves and others affects our home and work
        environments. Living in this world means interacting with many different
        types of people, as well as constant change and surprise. Emotional
        intelligence is the key to how we respond to what life gives us. It is
        also a key component of compassion and understanding the deeper reasons
        behind other people's actions.
