      <h1 id="margin-title">Differences between Margin, Border, and Padding</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>If you're new to CSS, you've probably never heard of the words margin, padding and border, and thatâ€™s totally fine! These concepts do similar things in CSS. However, they are not exactly the same, and there are some important fundamental differences in their use.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So, let's take a look at these attributes and what they do. We'll include plenty of visual examples to illustrate how these important CSS components work.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="pic">
        <img src="image/margin-padding-border.png" alt="short description">
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>In CSS, margin refers to the space around an element's border, while padding refers to the space between the element's border and the element's content. In other words, the margin property controls the space outside the element, while the padding property controls the space inside the element.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="pic">
        <img src="image/margin.png" alt="short description">
        <figcaption>margin</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img src="image/margin-code.png" alt="short description">
        <figcaption>code of margin</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img src="image/padding.png" alt="short description">
        <figcaption>margin</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img src="image/padding-code.png" alt="short description">
        <figcaption>code of margin</figcaption>
        <br>
      </div>
      
      <p>As for border, it controls the line between padding and margin. However, Padding is a CSS property that works only on elements that have borders, while margins can still affect an element whether or not it has borders. Another difference is that the background color of padding and borders can be customized, while margins are transparent</p>
      <p>Once you fully understand the difference between margins and padding, you will be able to make better design decisions for your website.</p>
