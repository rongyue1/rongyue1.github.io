      <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1> 
      <br><br>
      <h3>BEING BLOCKED</h3>
        <p>
          I got blocked quite a few times, don't know if I should call them 'simple problems' as they were like the Alps in my head
        </p>
        <P>
          One of them is especially hard for me, I'm saying about you map(). When I was dealing with .map(), god knows how much I miss my simple old friend for loops. I almost used all the problem-solving techniques on the list plus a lot of taking deep breath to help calm myself down and not thinking about smash my laptop. When I finally did it, it felt pretty good, and the code looks really simple just a few line of code. Just when I was about to relax, the second day, I got stuck on .map() again when doing another kata. Well, guess we are not friends yet. I learned that sometimes when I have successfully used the method once, it does not mean that I have mastered it, there is no end to learning.
        </P>
      <br><br>
      <h3>ELEGANCE</h3>
        <p>
          I would probably say when doing the Manipulating JS Objects. I googled and learned a bit about what are the Objects, property, values and keys mean and how to manipulate them. The instructions on this kata were pretty clear as well. I think it didn't take me a long time to finish this one and I felt that finally I'm making some progress, even just a little bit.
        </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES</h3><br>
        <h4>Pseudocode:</h4>
        <p>
          I'm still trying to get into the habit. The kata I've encountered so far are relatively small and simple ones, and I feel that the code is pretty self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying Something:</h4>
        <p>
          I use this technique the most, and in most cases I alter it here and there to see what comes up, although in most cases it's the red error message, well, worth a try though.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber Ducky Method:</h4>
        <p>
          I really like the principle of this technique, but like the Pseudocode technique, since the tasks I've encountered so far are relatively simple, I normally get stuck on syntax problems rather than logic. So, I haven’t use this method much yet, but I think it won’t be far for me to have to rely on this method a lot.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading Error Messages:</h4>
        <p>
          I like this one! It helps me to at least identify where I should be looking at.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging:</h4>
        <p>
          Console.log is my good friend!
        </p>
        <h4>Googling:</h4>
        <p>
          When I try to solve kata I often use Google, sometimes I search and read in English and sometimes in Chinese. There is a wealth of information in both languages for my problem, and quite often the information in both languages can do a pretty good job in making me confused.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Your Peers for Help:</h4>
        <p>
          Not very confident yet, but I guess it will get better when we move to face to face Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Coaches for Help:</h4>
        <p>
          Feeling least confident in this one as I’ve never been the student that raise their hands up and ask questions in class. Wish someday I’ll get better in this.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving Your Process with Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          This is something I am still working on.
