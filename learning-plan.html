      <h1>BOOTCAMP LEARNING PLAN</h1>
      <br />
      <h4>LONG-TERM GOAL</h4>
      <p>
        This is pretty much the same with my goal before Foundation. I’m still
        aiming to become a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>STRENGTHS and LIMITATIONS</h4>
      <p>
        Time management is still consider to be my weakness but I think is
        getting better,and being curios is my strength. Another strength I found
        during Foundation is that I am able to maintain a positive attitude when
        facing challenges.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Being able to confidently share my opinions and thoughts, be brave
        enough to ask questions (which has been hard for me in my previous
        experience), make friends in Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>EXPECTATIONS FROM BOOTCAMP TEAM</h4>
      <p>
        My expectations from the Bootcamp team are that they will be patient,
        authentic and understanding. I know the next journey would be hard, I
        wish it could be a place that we can be vulnerable and feel safe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>EXPECTATIONS OF MYSELF</h4>
      <p>
        My expectations for myself are that I can focus on my studies even in
        difficult times. I hope that successfully completing my studies will
        give me more confidence and that I will be able to learn more about
        myself and be kind to myself. I want this to be something that I will be
        proud of.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h1>FOUNDATION LEARNING PLAN</h1>
      <br />
      <h4>LONG-TERM GOAL</h4>
      <p>
        Get a web developer job, learn new skills and be a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h4>
      <p>
        Time management is my weakness and being curios is my strength, so when
        the two combine together I could easily go down the rabbit hole!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p>Be more confident and make FRIENDS!</p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h4>
      <p>
        I relieve stress by doing meditation and journaling, and I seek
        professional help if needed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h4>
      <p>
        I will seek help when I have tried various methods on my own and still
        can't solve the problem.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>Authenticity, respect and understanding.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
