      <h1>LEARNING PLAN</h1>
      <br>
      <h4>LONG-TERM GOAL</h4>
      <p>Get a web developer job, learn new skills and be a full-stack developer.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p>Time management is my weakness and being curios is my strength, so when the two combine together I could easily go down the rabbit hole!</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>Be more confident and make FRIENDS!</p>
      <br>
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h4>
      <p>I relieve stress by doing meditation and journaling, and I seek professional help if needed.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
      <p>I will seek help when I have tried various methods on my own and still can't solve the problem.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>Authenticity, respect and understanding.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p>No.</p>
