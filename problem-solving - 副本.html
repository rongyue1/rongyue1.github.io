      <h1>NEUROPLASTICITY</h1> 
      <br><br>
      <h3>NEUROPLASTICITY BENEFITS</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity can help us learn how to learn better. When we are learning new things, our neurons are growing new pathways, and as we continue to practice (repetition matters!) and learn at high intensity, this neuron pathway in our brains is growing stronger and wider as we practice. Just like weight training will help grow muscles, we can exercise our brains and thus make them grow.
        </p>
        <P>
          Learning and growth here is not limited to learning a new skill, but also includes the way we think, our mindset, whether we have the confidence and resilience to face new challenges.
        </P>
      <br><br>
      <h3>ENGAGING NEUROPLASTICITY</h3>
        <p>
          Knowing this, the impact on me is that I can face challenges more positively and know that with constant practice and challenging myself I will get results and can change my brain and mind-set.
        </p>
        <P>I am going to try to practice more when I learn new skills, consolidate my learning, and use this as an opportunity to create new neuronal pathways when faced with challenges. When a critical voice comes up in my brain, I can change my thinking patterns by taking deep breaths and practicing mindfulness to stop the critical voice.</P>

        <P> to a YouTube video that I find very inspiring</P>

      <h3>PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES</h3><br>
        <h4>Pseudocode:</h4>
        <p>
          I'm still trying to get into the habit. The kata I've encountered so far are relatively small and simple ones, and I feel that the code is pretty self-explanatory.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying Something:</h4>
        <p>
          I use this technique the most, and in most cases I alter it here and there to see what comes up, although in most cases it's the red error message, well, worth a try though.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber Ducky Method:</h4>
        <p>
          I really like the principle of this technique, but like the Pseudocode technique, since the tasks I've encountered so far are relatively simple, I normally get stuck on syntax problems rather than logic. So, I haven’t use this method much yet, but I think it won’t be far for me to have to rely on this method a lot.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading Error Messages:</h4>
        <p>
          I like this one! It helps me to at least identify where I should be looking at.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging:</h4>
        <p>
          Console.log is my good friend!
        </p>
        <h4>Googling:</h4>
        <p>
          When I try to solve kata I often use Google, sometimes I search and read in English and sometimes in Chinese. There is a wealth of information in both languages for my problem, and quite often the information in both languages can do a pretty good job in making me confused.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Your Peers for Help:</h4>
        <p>
          Not very confident yet, but I guess it will get better when we move to face to face Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking Coaches for Help:</h4>
        <p>
          Feeling least confident in this one as I’ve never been the student that raise their hands up and ask questions in class. Wish someday I’ll get better in this.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving Your Process with Reflection:</h4>
        <p>
          This is something I am still working on.
