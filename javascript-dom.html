      <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1> 
      <br><br>
      <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3><br>
      <p>My favorite analogy of the relationship between JavaScript, HTML and CSS is that if a web page were a person, HTML would be the words the person says, CSS would be the clothes and accessories the person wears, and JavaScript would be the person's brain, the words they say are thought through by the brain and imply the logic of the person's mind.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Control flow and loops</h3><br>
      <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. When a computer gets a script, it ‘read’ the script from top to bottom. As for the loops, they are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.</p>
      <p>If I were to think of an analogy, control flow is like a cooking process where we first need to prepare the ingredients for the dish, then sautéed, then served on a plate, and then set on the table. And loops are like the process of, for example, stir-frying, keep stir-frying until the condition is met. What condition? That is when everything is cooked! Then, we can proceed to the next step, serving it on the plate.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>The DOM and how to use it</h3><br>
      <p>DOM is short for Document Object Model. It is the way a web browser represents a web page internally. For me, it’s like the web browser using different tags to translate the html script to a web page. We call it the DOM tree because it kind of looks like a tree upside down.</p>
      <div class="pic">
        <img style="height: 60%; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; display: block;" src="image/DOM TREE.jpg" alt="short description">
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>We can use a thing called DevTools to interact, or we could say manipulate, the web pages. In order to do that we can right click on a web page and click inspect, or press the F12 key. Then you will see something like the picture below. Go explore this in any way you want, don’t worry, you are not gonna change anything, have fun! </p><br>
      <div class="pic">
        <img style="height: 80%; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; display: block;" src="image/dom.png" alt="short description">

      </div>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h3><br>
      <p>Array, like list, is a data structure that contains a group of elements. 
        For example, this array contains 4 items, apple, banana, mango and grape.</p><br>
      <div class="pic">
        <img style="height: 60%; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; display: block;" src="image/array1.png" alt="short description">
        <br>
      </div><br>
      <p>In this ordered array, if we want to access any of them in this fruit array we can give the index number of the fruit. One thing to note is that an array start from zero not one. So, if we want to access the first fruit ‘apple’, we just need to type this in:</p>
      <div class="pic">
        <img style="height: 15%; width: 15%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; display: block;" src="image/array2.png" alt="short description">
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>As for objects, it is a little bit more complicated than array, took me a while to figure it out. For me they are like the lockers in changing room, you can put anything in objects (e.g. strings, numbers, even objects!), everything in objects has a key, just like in real life any locker has a key. We can use the key to access the value in the objects. The picture below shows an example of an object:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="pic">
        <img style="height: 40%; width: 40%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; display: block;" src="image/objects.png" alt="short description">
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>lockerOne, lockerTwo and lockerThree are the keys in the objects.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Functions and why they are helpful</h3><br>
      <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Remember the cooking example we just talked about in control flow? In a complete cooking process, we need many functions to help us cook smoothly. For example, first we might need a function to wash the vegetables, then a function to cut the vegetables once they are clean, and then a function to stir-fry them. By calling a function we tell the computer what to do. Here is a simple example of a greeting function, it prints ‘hello’ if we call the function:</p>
